## You Additions

The way I will make my game unique is to have the enemies come from all sides of the screen. All 4 sides of the screen will have enemies attack, but the way to make
it not TOO diffiuclt is that the side with the enemies attacking, there will be a red flashing line on that edge of the screen. Which then enemies will attack from
there. Another thing I want to try is to make it so the player can only move left and right and once they hit the side of the screen, they will rotate to the side
so that the ship moves around the inner perimeter of the screen.
